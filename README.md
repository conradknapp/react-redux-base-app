## Base React-Redux App

While learning Redux, I wanted to make a very simple application that would serve as a base for larger projects. I used the create-react-app cli and then brought in redux and react-redux and then scaffolded folders and files the way I found most scalable and understandable.

I referred to the Redux documentation most of all to find common patterns in structuring React-Redux apps: https://redux.js.org/

I might depart from using this in the future, but for now, it helps to have something basic that both serves as a reference and that works to start with so I can hit the ground running on new projects.
